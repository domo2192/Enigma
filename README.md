# Enigma

## Functionality 3
- Enigma was a difficult project but my project is able to both and encrypt
and decrypt properly with and without keys or dates. CLI is also implemented and
working appropriately.

## Object Oriented Programming 4
- I used both modules and inheritances. The reason I used one module is because it made more sense to be outside of a class as far as its encapsulation
responsibilities. It also made it easier for me to mock and stub certain things
when trying test them.

## Ruby conventions and Mechanics 4
- Best case enumerable are used. Spacing and Syntax and spacing is corrected.

## Test Driven Development 3
- Mocks and stubs are used my simplocov coverage states 90% but the index
only shows lines missing in the test setups or at the end of a method where I throw a ruby built in method on the end of a method.

## Version Control 3
- Enough commits and quality pull requests through out the project. Small logical
chunks of functionality.
